be a rare polymorphism
also in a patient with frontotemporal dementia dbSNP
loss of angiogenic activity reduced ribonucleolytic activity retains nuclear translocation
possibly hypomorphic allele reduces interaction with BRCA2 and to a lesser extent with PALB2 and RAD51
results in sequestration of sarcomeric and Z line proteins into intranuclear aggregates there is some evidence of muscle regeneration suggesting a compensatory effect
a moderate risk of breast cancer partially reduces kinase activity
the mutant protein is unstable with less than 5% of protein detectable compared to wild-type
be associated with cerebellar ataxia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
less than 50% of activity than wild-type dbSNP
the mutation dominantly affects the actin filament assembly likely resulting in abnormal cytoskeletal organization
squamous cell carcinoma dbSNP
reduced secretion to the medium localizes mainly to the Golgi apparatus dbSNP
restricts cell growth at elevated temperature or under hyperosmolar stress as measured in growth assays with yeast expressing the mutation
7.4% of wild-type enzyme activity
MEN2A and HSCR1 familial and sporadic forms dbSNP
results in stimulation of RYR channels activity with channels remaining open for longer times the mutation may impair insertion of the protein into the membrane to form a functioning ion channel
one individual with lung cancer
fails to localize to the plasma membrane
possibly contribute to susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus increases autophosphorylation and interaction with PI3-kinase subunit p85 dbSNP
be associated with PARK11
absence from the plasma-membrane exhibits no catalytic AMPase activity
the protein is normally bound to microtubules
not affect expression level, transactivational capacity and DNA binding ability
alters signal transduction of the receptor adenylate cyclase stimulation by FSH is 24 +-4% residual activity
shows a loss of epimerase activity towards partially desulfated dermatan sulfate patient- derived fibroblasts show also a significant reduction in activity
associated with disease susceptibility significantly attenuates alpha-secretase activity of the enzyme shifts APP processing toward beta- secretase-mediated cleavage resulting in enhanced beta-amyloid plaque load and reactive gliosis
associated with susceptibility to porphyria cutanea tarda associated with increased serum transferrin levels higher frequency in patients with type 2 diabetes than in controls dbSNP
Dallas O(2) affinity up
causes hypophosphatemic osteoporosis results in lower phosphate current, decreases affinity for phosphate and decreases phosphate uptake compared to wild-type shows a dominant-negative effect

effect on 17beta-HSD activity dbSNP
2.3% of wild-type activity
shows intracellular localization different from that of the wild-type protein forms a reticular pattern in the cytoplasm does not show submembranous distribution is abnormally retained in the endoplasmic reticulum consistent to improper folding

disease-associated mutation found in a patient with Wilms tumor does not suppress anchorage- independent cell growth dbSNP
NCMS and KNEN also found in lung carcinoma cell and melanoma dbSNP
partially retained in the endoplasmic reticulum results in reduced nucleoside transport
and PKU mild haplotypes 1,2,4,22, 24,28 dbSNP
and SLE strongly reduces activity produces a defective G1/S transition and chronic G2/M DNA damage checkpoint activation
resistance to nelfinavir when associated with other amino acid changes
loss of function mutation acting in a dominant-negative manner
associated with UV induced susceptibility to skin damage unresponsive to NDP-MSH stimulation
loss of cytoplasmic expression

defective enzyme secretion and activity
36.2% of wild-type enzyme activity also in GM1G1 and a patient with a slowly progressive GM1- gangliosidosis form
misfolded, accumulates in cells due to inefficient secretion induces the formation of deposits between Bruchs membrane and the retinal pigment epithelium where it accumulates
decreases secretion slightly increases homodimerization in absence of Ca(2+) no effect on protein folding dbSNP
reduces transcription transactivation upon aldosterone binding
the mutant protein has decreased GTPase activity compared to wild-type and causes disruption of endoplasmic reticulum network morphology
